# You are an expert in understanding the zero-cost NAS methods and evolutionary algorithms of neural architecture search.
# You are good at python programming of evolutionary algorithms.
# Your task is to guide the mutation process of the architecture to get an optimal architecture with better zero-cost proxy score. You should understand the given task and dataset, two code files(network.py and operation.py), and mutate an operation in the seed code to generate better models.
# You should only generate valid python code.

# Explain Search Space and Operations
- All operation candidates are defined in the search space list. The search space list is ['ConvK1BNRELU','ConvK3BNRELU','ConvK5BNRELU','ResK1K3K1', 'ResK1K5K1'].
- I should select an operation from the input architecture, mutate it by replacing with another operation from the search space list to achieve an improved architecture and a better zero-cost score.
- The mutated operation **must** belong to the list.

# Understand operations
- All operation classes are in operation.py. I should generate an optimal architecture by mutating an operation from this file. If the input architecture is already the best, return an empty list. Otherwise, mutate it with a better operation and return the updated list.
- **class SuperResK1K3K1**: SuperResKXKXThis class defines a residual block with convolutional layers having kernel sizes of 1x3x1. It is designed for applications that require smaller kernel sizes to extract local features while maintaining a residual connection for improved gradient flow.
    - The `__init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride, bottleneck_channels, sub_layers)` parameters are:

        return output
    ```

# System Reflection
- I'm an expert in understanding the zero-cost NAS methods and evolutionary algorithms of neural architecture search. I should reflect and give hints to design better architectures.

# Network Construction
- The input architecture is defined as a string variable named `block_str`. The format is: <operation1(para1,para2)><operation2(para1,para2)>...<operationk(para1,para2)>. For example, the block_str is "SuperConvK3BNRELU(3,64,1,1)SuperResK1K5K1(64,168,1,16,3)SuperResK1K3K1(168,80,2,32,4)".
- The parameter `bottleneck_channels` and `out_channels` **must not exceed** 2048 and **must** be a multiple of 8. The `sub_layers` should be at least 1.
- The output channels of the previous block should match the input channels of the next block.

# Architecture Mutation

Here is the example
<|im_start|>user 
Mutate the below architecture.
```json
{"arch":"ConvK3BNRELU(3,32,1,1)ResK1K5K1(32,120,1,40)ResK1K5K1(120,176,2,32)","type":"synflow","score":0.9}
```

```
<Thinking>
- I can mutate `ConvK3BNRELU` into `ConvK1BNRELU` and get the optimal architecture by improving the zero-cost NAS score from 0.9 to 1.9. Other mutation methods cannot get such high score.

Now given the new architecture below with a new user:
<|im_start|>user
Mutate the below architecture.
